<h1>🚀 Simple Keylogger Tool</h1>
    
  <p>This project is a basic keylogger tool developed using Python during my internship at Prodigy InfoTech. The tool captures keystrokes and saves them into a log file on the Desktop, with each session generating a new log file.</p>
    
   <h2>🔑 Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Automatic Logging:</strong> Keystrokes are captured in real-time and saved automatically.</li>
        <li><strong>Desktop Storage:</strong> Log files are stored directly on the Desktop with sequential naming (e.g., <code>keylog1.txt</code>, <code>keylog2.txt</code>).</li>
        <li><strong>Simple and Clean Code:</strong> The script is straightforward, making it easy for others to understand and modify.</li>
    </ul>
    
  <h2>💻 Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Python:</strong> The entire tool is written in Python.</li>
        <li><strong>Pynput Library:</strong> Used to capture keystrokes.</li>
    </ul>
    
  <h2>🔍 Use Case</h2>
    <p>This tool is for educational purposes and is intended to help individuals understand how keyloggers work in a controlled, ethical environment. It is important to always use such tools responsibly and with proper authorization.</p>
    
  <h2>⚠️ Disclaimer</h2>
